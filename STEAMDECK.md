# BakkesMod on Steam Deck

**The installation steps are pretty much the same** because the Steam Deck runs pretty much a modified Arch Linux installation.

Thanks [EmeraldWither](https://github.com/EmeraldWither) for this section.

## Setup

Switch your Steam Deck to [Desktop Mode](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C).

Install the `protontricks` Flatpak. (This can be accomplished via the [Discover](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C) app)

## Installation

Follow the instructions [here](README.md#installation). Choose the `protontricks` options.

## After installation

You'll probably want to set up an automatic script that launches BakesMod alongside Rocket League. If that's the case, follow the instructions [here](README.md#automatically).

## Tips

Whenever you want to use the BakkesMod window, hold down the `Steam` button and use the right trackpad and triggers to use the mouse.

Opening the BakkesMod window is done with the `F2` key (and closing with `Esc`). I suggest you bind those keys to some buttons on your Steam Deck.
